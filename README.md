# Calculator
This is a basic calculator built using the Shunting Yard Algorithm.

To replicate this project, it is essential to understand what the Shunting Yard Algorithm is and how it works.

Helpful Resources
The following videos helped me understand the Shunting Yard Algorithm:

Video 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceu-7gV1wd0&t=1492s (Although this video is an hour long, you only need to watch the first 25 minutes. Do not skip any part of this section!)

Video 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VjJe1PeExQ&t=251s 

These resources provide clear explanations and step-by-step demonstrations that are highly recommended before proceeding with the implementation.

And also try solving equations using pen and paper first.
